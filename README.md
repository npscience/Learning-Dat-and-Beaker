# Learning Dat and Beaker

This repository contains my notes as I learnt about [Dat](https://datproject.org) and [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com) â€” tools for creating and sharing files through a decentralised p2p infrastructure.

## My goals

**Dat**
- [ ] **WIP** To understand how Dat works and the benefit it brings over sharing research data via online repositories on the web (with DOIs pointing to landing pages via HTTP). See the [Dat whitepaper](https://github.com/datproject/docs/blob/master/papers/dat-paper.md)
- [x] Learn how to use Dat ![Try-dat:success badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try--dat-success-green.svg) [Notes](/Try-dat.md)

**Beaker**
- [ ] **WIP** To learn how Beaker works and its benefits
- [x] Learn how to create a site on Beaker (basic and Pipette) [Notes](/Try-beaker.md)
- [ ] Learn how to create a blogsite on Beaker via Jekyll

**Basic web development**
- [x] Consider how to build a website [Notes](/Making-my-site.md)
- [x] Learn how to create a site using Hugo and Netlify [Notes](/Learn-Hugo.md)
